Neil will be teaching a one-day seminar on Saturday 23rd April at the Paisley dojo, UWS Campus.
Time: 11:30-14:30
This is a great chance to train with fellow students from the Glasgow and Paisley dojos and is also a good revision seminar for the up-coming Spring gradings.
There will be a few spaces in at least one car going through from Edinburgh on the day, so get in touch if you'd like to join us!
