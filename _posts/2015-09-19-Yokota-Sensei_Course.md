**Sliven Aikikai 20th Anniversary**
<br>
This weekend some of our members are attending a course in Sliven to celebrate 20 years of their dojo Run by Rado Marinov.

To give a taste of the type of Aikido they will be practicing here is part of Yokota Sensei teaching in Hombu Dojo to give you a flavour of their weekend.
