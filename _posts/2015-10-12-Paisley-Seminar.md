**Paisley Seminar**

Neil will be teaching a Saturday Seminar on Sat 17th October through at the Paisley dojo.

Venue:

Robertson Sports Centre

University of West of Scotland

Thornly Park Campus

Caplethill Rd

Paisely

PA2 7TR


Training times: 10am-1pm.

This is a great chance to train with fellow aikidoka from the Glasgow and Paisley dojos and is also a good revision seminar for the up-coming autumn/winter gradings.
There will be a few spaces in at least one car going through from Edinburgh on the day, so get in touch if you'd like to join us
