Azami-Kai is pleased to announce we will be hosting an aikido seminar with Shigeru Sugawara shihan 7th Dan, from Hombu dojo, Japan. 

The dates of the seminar are February 19th-21st, with training during our regular Friday night slot in the Calton Centre, then on Saturday and Sunday at Ainslie Park Leisure Centre. 

This is our big annual event, and is only hosted in Edinburgh once every 2-years (being in London every other year). It's hoped all members of Azami-Kai dojos will be able to come along and train - beginners and improvers/seniors alike.

The seminar will be a chance to train under a Shihan from Japan, and will also give you the opportunity to train with advanced students and beginners from other dojos in the UK, Europe and further afield who travel to Edinburgh for this event. 

Sugawara Sensei always makes an effort to come round and throw everyone and make points that will improve your aikido, so even if you're very new to aikido, you'll find the seminar supportive and inspiring.
