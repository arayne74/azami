**Edinburgh:** 
As most people now know we are in the process of leaving the Carlton Centre. From now on the only class that will be at the Carlton Centre will be the Wednesday night class. This will continue for the next couple of weeks till we secure a new venue for that. All other classes kids/mornings/friday nights will be at the Crags (See Edinburgh Dojo page for details.)

Additionally the friday class is moving to 1830-2030. Hopefully this will ease pressure on people to make it to the friday night double class and help some students from other dojos to attend.
